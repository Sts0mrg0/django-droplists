# Domains Django Project #

## About ##

A simple django app to grab and analyse domains from the pool.com droplist.

This really is a bare bones thing, it could do with the addition of elasticsearch and some chainable filters.

e.g. dictionary search, ignore certain tlds, ignore domains with numbers, hyphens.... etc

Please fork and go nuts.

## Prerequisites ##

- Python >= 2.5
- pip
- virtualenv (virtualenvwrapper is recommended for use during development)

## Installation ##

Fill out with installation instructions for your project.
